Hello

This programs idea comes from an old IT168-IT179 Java program

Idea:
Have a program that replicates an ATM with simple functions such as:

Enter Pin
Check Balance
Deposit
Withdraw Funds
Create account


Other functions or ideas can be added to add more use cases to the program.

My idea for the program is to create a class object in CPP that holds basic information for an "ATM account"
Then create functions to do some of the things listed above

Main:
The main will just be a loop that checks what you what to do next;
In main we can also make a few dummy accounts that are just automatically loaded when the program is executed

Other Functions:
(I dont have any yet but if anyone wants to add after this line please do!)
